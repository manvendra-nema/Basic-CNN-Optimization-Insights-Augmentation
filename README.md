## Introduction
In this project, we explore the development of CNN architectures for digit recognition tasks using the MNIST dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of various data augmentation techniques on model performance.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Part 1: Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
- Visualize 5 random images from 5 different digits.
- Explore various CNN configurations, including kernel sizes, feature maps, pooling techniques, activation functions, strides, and padding.
- Evaluate model performance using loss and accuracy plots for different configurations.

## Part 2: Data Augmentation
- Apply different augmentation techniques, including resizing, left-right flipping, rotation, and adding Gaussian noise, to enhance the training dataset.
- Evaluate the performance of the augmented data using loss and accuracy plots.
- Analyze the role of different augmentation techniques in improving model accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of CNN-based digit recognition and the role of data augmentation in improving model performance. By exploring various CNN configurations and augmentation techniques, we aim to build robust models capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits.
